# Tetris

Contains all the code I've written as part of my final project for ECE150, Digital Logic Design

Tetromino Generator contains code for generating and shifting Tetris shapes 
	to be programmed into an EPROM 

GAL Programming contains JEDEC files for programming GAL chips for specialized use.
	These were approved in order to greatly reduce the number of chips and boards, 
		without having to order specialized chips with inconvenient pinouts, etc.

Tetromino Generator:

	BoolStr contains functions for manipulating 8bit arrays of booleans
	
	input.txt contains each shape in various orientations
		Order of Significance:
			3 MSB address the Shape
			2 bits address the orientation
			3 bits address the "offset," or "skew" 
				These are generated by the loop in shapeTest calling s3bs()
			2 bits addressing each individual row

		Currently contains all 7 shapes in blocks of 4 rows; 
			each block contains 1 orientation of each shape, making 
				7shapes x 4orientations x 4 rows = 112 rows.
	
	shapeTest.c prints out all the possible offsets of each shape's orientations
		The output from shapeTest is redirected into Swag.txt. 
		The debugging output is cleaned up, and used as input to bintext2bin

	bintext2bin.c converts input from a text file containing 8bit rows 
		into a bin file with equivalent information. (output.bin)

	input.txt --> Swag.txt --> output.bin --> EEPROM

GAL Programming:

	4bitswitch.PLD contains CUPL for switching between 4 sets of 2 inputs with 1 address pin.

	8bitAndNor.PLD contains CUPL for an 8 input AND, 8 input OR, and buffers 4 inputs for wiring convenience.


PLD files were compiled using WinCUPL on JLAB computer (Junior 04)
